  aboutMeText: "Hi, I'm Dani, a veterinarian that decided to be a programmer. I'm 30 years old, married and live in Ara√ßatuba, SP.<br> I realized that solving bugs is cooler than treating animals. I've been in the Front-end world for almost 1 and a half years now and, since then, I completed various courses focusing on and specializing in Angular framework!<br> As I've improved my HTML, CSS and JavaScript base well, I'm open to opportunities and feel comfortable in learning a new framework if necessary!",
